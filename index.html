                        <li><strong>Check (and double check!) the accuracy of the outputs.</strong> AI is a great tool, but it has a tendency to hallucinate, especially when it's not given enough information.</li>
                        <li><strong>Put your human abilities to work.</strong> While the outputs of these prompts act as a strong starting point, they're not perfect. Still put a dedicated effort into revising and shaping your case study. We'll all benefit from it!</li>

You know how to write very well, keeping your articles professional but not corporate. You appreciate a well-timed quippy sentence. You've moved from your career as a journalist and now write case studies that are used by a big tech company to market to merchants who are looking for a new commerce platform but want a partner to help them. Your writing balances professional clarity with engaging narrative—maintaining credibility while avoiding corporate jargon. You excel at transforming technical implementations into business-focused stories that resonate with decision-makers.

As a case study writer for a leading commerce platform, your expertise includes:
- Extracting the most compelling metrics and business outcomes from complex projects
- Structuring narratives that highlight both partner expertise and merchant transformation
- Creating concise, scannable content that emphasizes quantifiable results
- Balancing technical implementation details with strategic business impact
- Maintaining brand voice while adapting to various industries and merchant types

Your task is to create a high-quality case study that showcases how a partner agency helped a merchant succeed with Shopify. The content should highlight the partner's approach, the technical solution implemented, and the measurable business impact for the merchant—all while maintaining a professional but accessible tone that appeals to potential commerce platform customers.

I'm going to give you an artifact doc. It contains case study examples, a case study template, and some additional style guidelines. I'd like you to learn the voice, tone, style, and formatting of them.

Next, I'm going to give you information about a new partner and merchant that we'd like to write a new case study about. Use the relevant information throughout the case study as you see fit to match the voice, tone, style, and formatting of the examples. Do not include any information from the examples in this draft, and do not pull anything from the web. Also do not edit the provided quotes, and instead use them directly.

After taking in this information, you can get to work writing a draft that matches the voice, tone, style, and formatting of the examples, but uses the information provided on the new customer.

Once you're ready, say "My training is now complete! I'm ready to help you draft a new case study. Remember: The more specific information you share, the better the draft will be!

You can input that information now."</div>

ATTITUDE Living launches multi-country stores on Shopify Hydrogen and Oxygen, increasing new customers by 9%

Inspired by the founder's desire to provide clean and effective products for his growing family, ATTITUDE Living embodies a deep commitment to transparency and care—both for individuals and the planet. Since 2006, ATTITUDE has been on a mission to revolutionize the home, body, and face industry by offering clean products in eco-innovative packaging designed to reduce plastic.

When their front-end technology provider announced it was sunsetting its platform, ATTITUDE was in need of a new solution that would empower them to build informative, dynamic product pages. They wanted to expand their existing Shopify footprint, appreciating the design flexibility and the site speed that the headless approach already gave them on the back end. And they looked to Novatize as the partner to help them achieve it.

By migrating their front end to Shopify, ATTITUDE saw these results:
9% increase in new customers
15% increase in average revenue per user (ARPU)
10% increase in average order value (AOV)
40% improvement in page load time

The challenge: Choosing a fast and flexible headless architecture
With their front-end technology no longer supported, ATTITUDE looked to implement a new headless architecture. They'd also recently needed to migrate off a third-party content management system (CMS), so they wanted a front end that could independently support their content needs. 

With Shopify's UX/UI flexibility and powerful site speed, ATTITUDE knew it was the right choice. Faced with the high competition of the beauty industry, they wanted their front-end design to stand out while still being lightning fast. Specifically, they wanted to display all relevant images, brand messaging, and product information on product detail pages (PDPs), as well as build a creative way to help customers discover their wide range of products with a new menu banner.

Beyond improving the experience across their pages, ATTITUDE also looked to consolidate multiple stores down to one in each region. That way, they could focus on optimizing operations and unifying their brand identity, along with lower costs and reducing third-party dependent maintenance fees.

With their decision to migrate to Shopify locked in, ATTITUDE needed the right partner to make it happen. For this, they had three criteria—the partner needed to be Shopify certified, local to their Montreal, Canada headquarters, and speak French. As a firm specializing in unified commerce, Novatize checked all of the boxes.

The solution: Building clean, dynamic sites with Shopify Hydrogen and Oxygen
With Novatize on board, the team set to migrate the front end of ATTITUDE's websites to Shopify. Above all else, ATTITUDE wanted their sites to be both high performing and easy to maintain. Using Shopify Hydrogen as the headless commerce solution, combined with Shopify Oxygen for global hosting, Novatize built the sites with Remix to keep the custom storefronts performing quickly with a modern, streamlined developer experience.

From there, Novatize and ATTITUDE shifted the focus to elevating the sites' design and shopper experiences, using the Shogun app as their landing page builder.

Creating custom pages with Shopify metaobjects
Using Shopify's metaobjects and metafields, ATTITUDE now dynamically manages content without relying on an external CMS. They can easily customize product pages and market-specific information directly through Shopify. Also, because Novatize rebuilt their websites using a single master site, the team can seamlessly manage content, products, and campaigns across multiple markets and languages.

Take ATTITUDE's sun care product discovery page. It features interactive filters that help shoppers quickly find products that match their specific needs, such as UV protection level or natural ingredients. This approach enhances the shopping experience by giving visitors the ability to filter and discover relevant products, while the simple and modern visual design reinforces ATTITUDE's eco-friendly mission by highlighting their commitment to environmental protection through planet-friendly product choices.

From there, each product page is designed to highlight clear and detailed information such as natural ingredients, eco-friendly certifications, and the benefits of the product for the skin and the environment. With several certifications—including EWG VERIFIED, PETA, and FSC—ATTITUDE uses cutting-edge scientific research to ensure their products are free from harmful ingredients. The dynamic structure combines server-side rendering with client-side interactivity to recommend complementary products based on the shopper's preferences or previous purchases, such as additional care adapted to their routine.

The results: An optimized international headless platform
Now that all of ATTITUDE's sites share the same headless Shopify Hydrogen codebase, the team manages a flexible environment that's ready for future projects. The dynamic Hydrogen architecture allows ATTITUDE to deliver a consistent user experience and meet the specific needs of each market, resulting in a 9% increase in new customers. The implemented solution also offers intuitive Shopify store management in two distinct languages, French and English, across multiple sales regions in Canada and the US—creating a 15% increase in average purchase revenue per user.

"We're proud to have partnered with ATTITUDE Living to build a high-performance, headless Shopify Hydrogen storefront that reflects their commitment to sustainability. Throughout the project, we have worked with their team to ensure they have full control over the solution moving forward."
—Philippe Pâquet-De Varennes, Vice President of Sales, Novatize

By opting for a purely headless architecture native to Shopify that doesn't rely on a third-party CMS, Novatize eliminated caching delays and unnecessary costs. Instead, that necessary functionality is built directly into the Shopify application API, guaranteeing a fluid and responsive user experience in all languages, improving page load time by 40%, and ultimately helping ATTITUDE grow their business.</div>

Stadium Goods achieved an 80% increase in conversion with VAAN and Shopify


Stadium Goods, a leader in rare sneakers and streetwear, faced mounting challenges with their bespoke ecommerce platform FPS, including slow site speed, high maintenance costs, and limited scalability. The Stadium Goods site was hindering the brand's ability to grow and maintain their reputation for exceptional service. Partnering with VAAN and Shopify, Stadium Goods replatformed to Shopify to unlock greater efficiency, flexibility, and customer satisfaction.

Since moving to Shopify and working with VAAN, Stadium Goods has seen:

An 80% overall increase in conversion rate
A 36% YOY increase in Black Friday and Cyber Monday (BFCM) web conversion rate
A 100% YOY increase in BFCM app conversion rate
A 46% increase in add-to-cart rate

The challenge: Scaling a marketplace for rare sneakers
Stadium Goods built their reputation as a go-to marketplace for rare sneakers and streetwear with a unique two-way model that tracks serialized inventory and assigns custom prices to individual items. However, as the business scaled into a direct-to-consumer and multichannel powerhouse, their custom ecommerce platform became a liability.

Their bespoke platform suffered with slow site speeds, frequent technical challenges, and high maintenance costs, which limited Stadium Goods' ability to grow and adapt quickly. They needed a modern, scalable solution that could handle their complex marketplace operations while enhancing the customer experience and reducing operational inefficiencies.

"The Stadium Goods team, like many merchants, often discussed migrating to Shopify due to roadblocks with their current platform while having unique consigner requirements. By working in lockstep with Vann and Stadium Goods, we were able to propose a solution that not only met their needs but also positions them well for future growth."
—Allyssa Wickens, Account Executive Large Accounts, Shopify

The solution: Migrating to Shopify before the holiday season
To address these challenges, Stadium Goods partnered with VAAN to migrate from their custom bespoke platform to Shopify. The project required a rapid turnaround to ensure the new platform was live before the peak of the holiday season. Detailed guidance on optimizing product structure, data migration paths, and aligning their PIM and OMS workflows was vital. Key aspects of the solution included:

Data migration oversight: Migration of the extensive product catalog, serialized inventory, and customer data to Shopify ensured the integrity of their marketplace model.
Optimized design: Applying their Brand Conversion Design philosophy, the VAAN team optimized the site design in accordance with Shopify theme-design paradigms.
Custom integrations: Tapcart was implemented for mobile app functionality and Braze for advanced email marketing, supporting Stadium Goods' omnichannel strategy.
Back-end flexibility: The migration simplified content and theme management, allowing the internal team to handle updates while freeing developers to focus on innovation.

"VAAN has been an incredibly nimble, collaborative, and impactful partner, helping us migrate from a custom eCommerce platform to Shopify at lightning speed. We set a very aggressive timeline (in spite of our size and complexity), and we hit it, landing one of the smoothest platform migrations I've seen, in time for holiday peak. A few weeks post-transition, we're already seeing a double-digit improvement in conversion rate, and material reduction in our cost of ownership. VAAN was instrumental in this achievement."
—Illarion Koperski, CTO, Stadium Goods

The Results: Dramatic increases in conversion and add-to-cart rate
The transition to Shopify transformed Stadium Goods' ecommerce performance. The platform's robust infrastructure and VAAN's streamlined design contributed to an 80% increase in conversion rates and substantial savings in total cost of ownership.

Stadium Goods' journey to Shopify highlights the impact of a well-executed platform migration. With VAAN's expertise, they've not only solved the issues of speed, flexibility, and cost, but have positioned themselves for scalable, sustainable growth in the DTC market.

"At VAAN, we prioritize leveraging public dependencies and resources to ensure flexibility and compatibility with Stadium Goods' preferred systems. This approach enabled a seamless migration to GitLab alongside the transition to Shopify. By utilizing docker containers to encapsulate processes, we ensured consistent functionality regardless of the environment in which they run."
—Illarion Koperski, CTO, Stadium Goods

"Our goal is to empower clients by providing everything they need—whether it's direct access to the code or ensuring any external dependencies are publicly available," says Illarion Koperski. "This way, we avoid creating restrictions or owning critical components, giving merchants full access and control over their systems."

The Stadium Team also saw an increase of 46% in add-to-cart rate as a result of replatforming to Shopify, as well as significant year-over-year increases in conversion during their peak Black Friday Cyber Monday sales with a 36% YOY increase in BFCM web conversion rate and a 100% YOY increase in BFCM app conversion rate with their Tapcart instance.

The Shopify replatforming has given Stadium Goods a powerful, adaptable digital presence that resonates with their brand and supports their future ambitions. Through a strategic partnership with VAAN and the power of Shopify, Stadium Goods now stands equipped to lead and grow in an ever-evolving market.</div>

quip improves ways of working, increases speed and agility after replatforming to Shopify

Founded in 2015, quip set out to revolutionize oral care with a simple mission: to make dental hygiene more accessible, effective, and stylish. Frustrated with overcomplicated, expensive toothbrushes and the lack of dental hygiene innovation, quip wanted to create a product that was both functional and beautifully designed.
With a focus on minimalist, user-friendly design, quip introduced an affordable electric toothbrush paired with a subscription model that delivered brush heads and dental hygiene products directly to customers. 
This approach simplified oral care for millions of customers, but ironically, quip soon faced similar frustrations with its custom-built ecommerce platform. Much like the bulky, inefficient toothbrushes they sought to replace, their homegrown solution became cumbersome, hard to scale, and a drain on resources. quip needed a platform that, like their product, was simple, reliable, and capable of growing with them—and that's when they turned to Avex to migrate them to Shopify.
Since moving to Shopify, quip has seen major results:
70% decrease in customer experience cases regarding refill plan management (via Recharge)
45% decrease in customer experience cases regarding warranty (via Loop)
The challenge: When a homegrown platform becomes a roadblock
quip's custom-built ecommerce platform, while once an asset, quickly became a roadblock as the brand experienced rapid growth. The escalating demand for custom coding to support new features and product launches placed immense pressure on the tech team, which was continually engaged in a cycle of heavy development and technical maintenance.

This relentless focus on upkeep left little room for innovation. Each new product update became a time-consuming task, requiring extensive development resources that delayed timelines and limited the brand's agility in the market. As a result, quip struggled to adapt to changing consumer demands and emerging trends, leading to missed opportunities for growth.

Moreover, the challenges of scaling the platform negatively affected the overall customer experience. With sluggish updates and limited functionality, including search features, customers encountered frustrations that diminished their satisfaction and loyalty to the brand. 

The solution: quip replatforms to Shopify for greater agility
To tackle quip's challenges with scalability and operational efficiency, Avex used Shopify's robust capabilities as a high-performance platform designed specifically for high-growth brands. Shopify offered a comprehensive solution through its scalable infrastructure, robust APIs, and access to Shopify's expansive app ecosystem, providing the tools and integrations necessary to meet quip's growing demands.

"Avex understood what we were trying to achieve and worked tirelessly to help us in our (incredibly rapid!) transition. It was clear that the company's expertise and connection with Shopify was remarkably strong, and we appreciated the leadership in guiding the process while also being flexible to suit our unique business needs."
—Meredith Glansberg, Chief Revenue Officer, quip

Migrate quickly, with data intact
The migration was completed within four months, starting with a detailed discovery phase to assess quip's needs. The first priority was the data migration process, which involved precise mapping of products, customer profiles, and order histories. Avex ensured that no historical data was lost and that all customer accounts and orders remained accurate and operational post-migration.

To meet the accelerated timeline, Avex also used one of its custom Shopify themes, which was modified to align with quip's brand guidelines. This allowed the team to streamline the development process while maintaining the brand's identity.

Use subscriptions to encourage better health outcomes
Subscription is not only a major revenue driver for quip, but is also critical to the company's health-focused mission: People should change their toothbrush every three months, but the majority don't. quip's subscription offering helps customers check one critical "to do" item off their list and contributes to better oral health outcomes. Avex and quip worked closely with Recharge to implement custom subscription logic. For instance, when customers purchase a toothbrush, they can subscribe exclusively to receive replacement brush heads, offering a more tailored experience and encouraging long-term retention.

The ability for customers to more easily automate their customer service request needs and manage their subscriptions via Recharge has also reduced cases for the company by 70%, allowing for more focus on improving customer experience and loyalty.

Quickly update content to capitalize on key moments
One of the key advantages quip gained by migrating to Shopify was the ability to easily update content using the Shopify page builder, without relying on a tech team. Its drag-and-drop functionality empowers quip's marketing and content teams to make real-time updates to product pages, landing pages, and promotions without needing coding knowledge.

Since moving to Shopify, quip has been able to capitalize on market trends and make page improvements at a fraction of the speed and with less resources than in the past. Quip launched their award-winning 360 Oscillating Toothbrush onto the new site and has been able to over-achieve sales expectations with Shopify's capabilities. 

quip also launched their Gift Guide on the site in time for pre-Black Friday sales. This guide allowed shoppers to dive right into the idea of oral care gifting, driving conversion during the key holiday season for the brand.

The results: Better ecommerce, made simple
quip's replatform to Shopify through Avex has been transformative, directly addressing their operational challenges and setting a solid foundation for future growth. Customers have appreciated the significantly improved user experience and have responded to the self-service subscription options very positively. 

"We have continued to get feedback on the enhanced user experience as a result of our migration to Shopify (and partnership with Recharge). Moving to a headed experience with Shopify via our Avex partnership is now allowing us to take advantage of this ecosystem and move more quickly and nimbly to continue to grow our business."
—Meredith Glansberg, Chief Revenue Officer, quip

Now, the brand is unlocking the full power of Shopify's capabilities and vast app ecosystem, enabling rapid and effective solutions tailored to their evolving needs. This newfound flexibility allows them to seamlessly integrate a variety of tools, such as Loop and Yotpo, to streamline operations, elevate customer interactions, and drive efficiency. After integrating Loop with their Shopify platform, quip was able to connect their warranty program more closely to the post-purchase experience, resulting in a 45% decrease in warranty cases.

With this strategic shift to Shopify, quip is poised not only for immediate success but also for long-term growth in the competitive ecommerce landscape. The future looks bright!</div>

Bambi Baby Reduces Checkout Times Across Retail Stores and Boosts Conversion Rates by 30%

Since 1976, Bambi Baby has grown from a small family-owned department store into a leading specialty furniture retailer offering baby furniture, baby gear, car seats, and more. With five retail locations across New York, New Jersey, and Florida, plus a thriving ecommerce business, they've built their reputation on providing personalized service and expert guidance to new parents selecting all the essentials for their growing families.

But as the business expanded, Bambi Baby's manual processes and disconnected commerce systems couldn't keep pace with customer expectations for fast, efficient service. Unifying their sales channels on Shopify helped them overcome these challenges. In the four months since replatforming, Bambi Baby has seen remarkable results, including: 

30% growth in conversion rates online and offline
30% growth in average order values (AOV)
Reduced in-store checkout times from several minutes to seconds
Increased repeat purchases and customer lifetime value (LTV) due to integrated loyalty rewards program across channels

The Challenge: Improving inefficient and manual processes
Before Shopify, Bambi Baby struggled to find technology solutions that could scale with their business. In their stores, they had tried Fishbowl POS and their online store ran on BigCommerce, but they needed a unified solution that could support their growing omnichannel operations. This led them to fall back on manual processes that were growing unsustainable. 

Store associates, focused on helping customers select the right products, struggled to keep up with manual order entry, especially busy weekend hours. "We were doing pen and paper transactions using an Excel sheet, scanning them, and having back office enter orders," explains Josh Weiss, IT Director at Bambi Baby. "You'd come in on a Monday and have to enter 50 orders manually. It just became a process that was not sustainable."

The paper-based checkout process also created bottlenecks. "You'd have four or five people backed up trying to buy something," says Josh. "People were just like, 'I'm out of here.'" 

Inventory management was also an issue. Prior to Shopify, stores maintained minimal inventory and largely operated as showrooms. But this meant that when customers wanted to take products home same-day, they often had to drive 30 minutes to the warehouse, which was inconvenient and put unnecessary strain on warehouse operations.

The brand's loyalty program faced challenges as well, with in-store purchases requiring manual point tracking and customer service intervention to ensure rewards were properly credited. These technical limitations weren't just creating inefficiencies—they were actively holding back growth and hurting Bambi Baby's customer experience, especially as they continued to expand their brick-and-mortar presence. That's when they decided to move to Shopify. 

The Solution: A retail solution built for growth
Working with design and development agency Syatt, Bambi Baby replatformed to Shopify in just three months, launching both their website and point of sale systems across all locations. "I've never had a project be on time before from development to deployment," says Josh. "There's so many moving pieces and I was stressed, but it happened. It went off without a hitch."

Each store now operates multiple Shopify POS stations plus mobile devices, enabling staff to process transactions anywhere on the floor. "I can check four people out simultaneously and it takes minutes to do so," says Josh. Training new employees on the system takes just 35 minutes, and the intuitive interface allows staff to spend more time with customers. "Now I have time to be with people because the same 10 minutes I used to spend writing up orders, I can be upselling," explains Josh.

Inventory and order management have been transformed as well. With Shopify's multiple location inventory capabilities and visibility across locations, Bambi Baby can confidently stock all their stores, enabling customers to take products home same-day. "The ability for customers to pay and leave with a box has been great for growth," says Josh. "Buying baby gear is exciting for parents. They want to buy their stroller and go home and set it up." A seamless integration with their SellerCloud ERP system is also a key improvement, enabling efficient order fulfillment whether items are being picked up in-store or shipped from the warehouse. "It helps me operate a well-oiled machine," says Josh.

Shopify has also helped streamline the brand's loyalty program. The team uses Smile, a third-party app built for Shopify, to ensure rewards are instantly credited to Bambi Baby's customers regardless of where they shop. This efficiency extends to their promotional strategy too as the team can now manage discounts centrally and deploy them across both online and in-store channels instantly.

"The fact that I can be sitting 30 miles away from our closest store and can update all the point of sale devices with a new coupon through Shopify saves a ton of time. When staff arrive they just see a new button on the POS screen. It's that easy."
—Josh Weiss, IT Director, Bambi Baby

The Results: From manual to modernized retail
Shopify's impact was immediately apparent during Bambi Baby's annual car seat trade-up event, which draws hundreds of customers over two days. "In years past, because you couldn't check people out quickly enough, the volume in the store was claustrophobic with so many people waiting," explains Josh. "This year, with Shopify POS, we never felt overwhelmed because we could keep the line moving. We got 600 people through over the course of two days, and it worked exactly as we wanted with no hiccups."

This improved efficiency has translated into significant business growth. "Our conversion rate is up by 30%," says Josh, as customers no longer abandon purchases due to long checkout lines. "Our average order value is up by 30% too. I think that's just the ability for my team to be able to upsell. We have the time to be with people because we're not spending those minutes writing up orders."

The integrated loyalty program has transformed customer relationships, driving repeat purchases and increasing customer lifetime value. "We're seeing much less 'one and done' transactions. Now they're coming back for some of the smaller items because they know they're going to get to use those points," explains Josh.

Looking ahead, Bambi Baby is positioned for continued retail expansion. "The growth that we've experienced over the last four months we would not have been able to accomplish without Shopify and Shopify point of sale," says Josh. With the ability to quickly set up new locations by simply shipping down iPads and card readers, they have minimal barriers to launching new stores while maintaining consistent operations across their growing retail footprint.

"At the scale we're growing right now, I don't know how we would have done it without Shopify. Everything is managed from one place and it's so trainable—I can teach someone the POS system in 35 minutes. It doesn't slow us down anywhere. It's really instrumental in our growth."

How Omy Laboratoires boosted sales with a redesigned online store

Omy Laboratoires is a Canadian skincare brand founded in 2018 by Rachelle Séguin and Andrea Gomez. The brand offers fully customized face creams and serums made with 100% vegan ingredients. They're recognized as cosmetics industry innovators for their use of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze customers' skin to provide personalized skincare solutions.

When Omy decided to upgrade their Shopify theme to Online Store 2.0, the brand was looking to personalize the customer experience and increase front-end performance. They partnered with ecommerce specialist Novatize to complete the upgrade and improve the website's user experience. Since the upgrade, Omy has seen the following results:

100% uptime since launch and zero major problems
60% session increase year-over-year
35% increase in repeat business year-over-year
95% of sales made through ecommerce

The challenge: Optimizing the online store and reducing data management complexity
Omy was looking to upgrade their Shopify theme to Online Store 2.0, which would unlock faster loading times, dynamic page personalization, and an enhanced brand image. To achieve this, the Canadian skincare brand chose to partner with Novatize, a firm specialized in ecommerce.

Redesigning Omy's product customizer was a major focus of the collaboration. This feature of the website allows customers to create personalized skincare products with ingredients that meet their specific needs. But because Omy had recently changed the nomenclature of their ingredients as part of upgrading their manufacturing process, textures, and fragrances, they had to adapt the methodology for entering information into the brand's product database. This required Novatize to custom build the product customiser on Shopify.

Beyond redesigning the product customizer, Novatize also had to ensure the architecture of the new online store would be highly scalable yet simple enough for the Omy team to manage on their own.

The solution: Optimizing the user experience without adding complexity
Novatize and Omy worked closely together to design the new online store. The UX and UI design phases included a style guide to integrate all the brand's new assets, product sheets to provide complete transparency to consumers using metafields as product specs, the product customizer to meet the manufacturing processes of the brand, and user journeys focused on personalizing products to customers' unique needs.

The Novatize team then overhauled Omy's database for customizable products, including migrating historical product and client data. Because this customization empowers each customer to order unique products, their new database is now able to handle specific use cases such as when customers want to reorder customized products, review personalized formulas previously registered to their accounts, or continue receiving product subscriptions.

Novatize also ensured that Omy's nomenclature updates didn't impact the user experience on the website. The team crafted a dynamic attributes structure that now allows Omy to evolve their manufacturing process and product offering without compromising what customers see. By implementing a front-end logic tied to editable metafields, Omy now has autonomous capabilities to upgrade their customer experience so it stays aligned with their manufacturing process.

"The Novatize team really cared about the success of the project, and the technological opportunities Shopify offers. They managed the project as if it were their own. They went beyond their mandate to ensure that the Omy team had everything in hand to deliver the project on time."
—Edouard Garceau, Ecommerce Director, Omy Laboratoires

Beyond creating a scalable yet accessible architecture, Omy was able to enhance their brand image. Novatize designed simpler website imagery that gave consumers a better understanding of ingredient customization. The new graphics and techniques help customers easily use the product customizer and place their orders while also facilitating internal operations for the Omy team. For example, the colored labels for each ingredient in the personalized creams help users understand the added value of the customizable product. And because the ingredients are highlighted, this redesign also enables production staff to flow more efficiently.

On the site's front end, Novatize optimized key sections, such as the navigation menu and product sheets for both non-customized and customized products. These new sections have made the purchasing experience more fluid for customers, even if the products have complex characteristics. They also created a consistent site-wide experience, boosting credibility and aligning with the quality of Omy's products.

The results: Rejuvenated website boosts online sales
The launch of Omy's refreshed online store was a glowing success. Thanks to the preparation and close collaboration between Omy and Novatize, the launch was seamless. Since the redesign, Omy has seen an increase in sessions by 60%, with 95% of sales being made through their ecommerce platform. They've also celebrated a 35% increase in repeat business, alongside an increase in sales related to personalized products and 100% uptime since launch with zero major problems. Clearly, putting customer needs and preferences at the heart of the process paid off.</div>

- Include descriptive section headers that relate to the business or industry
- Vary sentence structures and avoid repetitive patterns like "It's not only X, but also Y"
- Be specific and concrete instead of using generic statements
- Never fabricate quotes if none are provided; instead use: [QUOTE NEEDED: Brief description of quote topic]

                        <div class="prompt-content">You are now an editor with expertise in Shopify's platform capabilities and partner program. Your task is to thoroughly review the drafted case study for detailed information about how this partner worked with the merchant to grow their business on Shopify. Often, these case studies come to you with missing information, and it's your job to identify where more information is needed.

Please evaluate the case study draft you just generated against the following criteria and flag any issues:

1. THE INTRO
Verify that the introduction contains information about the merchant including:
The products or services they provide
What they care about as a brand
When they were founded
A clear statement of challenges they faced
Why they chose to work with the partner
Three clear metrics that each contain a number

2. THE CHALLENGE
Verify that the section with "The challenge:" in the header contains information on:
A clear description of the challenges the merchant faced before they migrated to Shopify
Why each challenge was important to solve
A direct quote from the partner or merchant that relates to the challenges
Why they chose Shopify to address these challenges

3. THE SOLUTION
Verify that the section with "The solution:" contains information on:
The features or capabilities the merchant gained in moving to Shopify
How the partner helped implement these features
What these features allow the merchant to achieve that they previously couldn't
A direct quote about solution approach or implementation from the merchant or the partner

4. THE RESULTS
Verify that the section with "The results:" contains information on:
A description of the main outcomes of moving to Shopify
A description of my the merchant values the partner
A description of future plans the merchant and partner have to continue their growth
A direct quote from the merchant about results and business impact

OUTPUT FORMAT
For each section of the verification checklist, provide your assessment in this format:
[Section Name]: ✓ (Looks good!) or ❌ (more detail needed)
Output the text associated with the bullet in each section. For example, if "The challenge" section needs more information on why each challenge was important to solve, output: "❌ (more detail needed): Why each challenge was important to solve"
Reference specific text from the case study to point to where more detail is needed
If no issues are found in a section, simply mark it as complete.

At the end, provide an overall assessment:
ALL CLEAR: Case study has a satisfactory level of detail and includes all required story elements.
NEEDS REVISION: Case study is lacking detail in some areas that should be addressed.
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES: Case study lacks required components (metrics and/or quotes) and needs substantial revision.
Include a summary of the areas with most information missing if any are found.

If the overall assessment is either NEEDS REVISION or SIGNIFICANT ISSUES, also say: "Above are some areas where we suggest adding more information. Following the recommendations listed in the overall assessment, provide this additional information (as either bullets or sentences) to update the draft.

You can free-type the responses to these required improvement areas. The AI tool will give feedback on what information feels satisfactory and where you still need to provide more details."

Once they have provided all the necessary additional information, draft a revised case study that incorporates these new inputs.</div>
